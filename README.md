# Terraform Module: Nexus Repository Manager Pro

This repository contains a Terraform Module that will deploy an Active-Active Cluster of Nexus Repository Manager Pro.

It has some pre-requisites:
- You have already got a PostgreSQL service available, know where it is and have ADMIN access to it
- You have a valid Sonatype license file for Nexus Repository Pro

An exmaple using this module can be found in [tools-nxrm-ha-cluster](https://github.com/vendorcorp/tools-nxrm-ha-cluster).

# The Fine Print

At the time of writing I work for Sonatype, and it is worth nothing that this is **NOT SUPPORTED** bu Sonatype - it is purely a contribution to the open source community (read: you!).

Remember:
- Use this contribution at the risk tolerance that you have
- Do NOT file Sonatype support tickets related to cheque support in regard to this project
- DO file issues here on GitHub, so that the community can pitch in
